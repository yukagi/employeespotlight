This is the Employee Spotlight application for Warner Fleet Services. This is a place for the administration of WFS to add new employees and update interesting information about those employees. It is also a place for other employees and customers to go in order to learn more about the team that makes WFS so great. 

It is a very simple application that has a index page showing all employees, and a show page displaying all relevant information about that employee. There is an admin section
at /admin that allows there to be (currently) a single adminstrator account to CRUD employees.
